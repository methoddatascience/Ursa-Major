Link- https://www.kaggle.com/flenderson/sales-analysis
Description- Hello. Attached is a set of products in which we are trying to determine which products we should continue to sell, and which products to remove from our inventory. The file contains BOTH historical sales data AND active inventory, which can be discerned with the column titled "File Type". The historical data shows sales for the past 6 months. 
Target variable- SoldFlag: 1 = sold in past 6 mos. 0 = Not sold 
Other variables- 
                - Order
                - File_Type  - The file contains historical sales data (identified with the column titled File_Type) along with current                                  active inventory that is in need of evaluation (i.e., File Type = "Active").
                - SKU_number  - This is the unique identifier for each product
                 - SoldFlag
                - SoldCount
                - MarketingType  - Two categories of how we market the product. This should probably be ignored, or better yet, each type                                    should be considered independently.
                - ReleaseNumber
                - New_Release_Flag - Any product that has had a future release (i.e., Release Number > 1)
                - StrengthFactor
                - PriceReg
                - ReleaseYear
                - ItemCount
                - LowUserPrice
                - LowNetPrice
